# Sun-spot Project 
##### This project shows how the sun-spot changes with time.
##### Sunspots are darker, cooler areas on the surface of the sun in a region called the photosphere. The photosphere has a temperature of 5,800 degrees Kelvin. Sunspots have temperatures of about 3,800 degrees K. They look dark only in comparison with the brighter and hotter regions of the photosphere around them.
This project uses a model specially created for sequential or time series dataset using LSTM and RNN, with proper visualisation and windowed dataset created for time series data. It predicts how the sun-spot will change with time.
###### I learned all this code from Tensorflow in practice specialisation from DeepLearning.ai at Coursera.
###### After going through the playlist I was able to code the same easily.
###### For proper understanding you can also go through my blogs on https://abhishek-parashar.github.io/. I write about Deep Learning, Machine learning, GANs and some random stuff. 
###### Feel free to suggest new topics for blogs or if you find a problem in any of the repositories raise an issue. I would do my best to resolve that at the earliest.
